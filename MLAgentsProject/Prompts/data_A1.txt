	1. **Domains**: Basic Math, Grammar, and Spelling.
	2. **Contexts**: Varied contexts within each domain to ensure comprehensive coverage.
	3. **Systems**: Different AI systems like "Math Tutor AI," "Grammar Helper AI," and "Spelling Checker AI" to diversify the training scenarios.
	4. **User Prompts**:
	   - For Basic Math: Included addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems with varied phrasing (e.g., spelling out numbers, using digits, and mixing both). Also included logical questions and true/false statements. Examples:
		 - "What is 5 plus five?"
		 - "Subtract 7 from ten thousand."
		 - "What is 3 times four hundred?"
		 - "Divide 20 by four."
		 - "Is 6 positive?"
		 - "A right triangle has 90 degrees, true or false?"
		 - "What is the square root of 16?"
		 - "Is zero an even number?"
		 - "Is 15 greater than 10?"
		 - "True or false: 2 is a prime number."
	   - For Grammar: Included verb forms, pluralization, adjectives, and logical questions. Examples:
		 - "What is the past tense of run?"
		 - "What is the plural of child?"
		 - "What is the comparative form of good?"
		 - "Is 'quickly' an adverb?"
		 - "True or false: 'She run fast' is grammatically correct."
		 - "What is the superlative form of bad?"
		 - "Is 'they' a pronoun?"
		 - "What is the past tense of 'go'?"
		 - "Is 'beautiful' an adjective?"
		 - "True or false: 'He is tallest' is correct."
	   - For Spelling: Included correct and incorrect spellings, with prompts asking if a word is spelled correctly. Examples:
		 - "Is 'accommodate' spelled correctly?"
		 - "Is 'definately' spelled correctly?"
		 - "Spell the word 'necessary'."
		 - "Which is correct: 'recieve' or 'receive'?"
		 - "Is 'privilege' spelled correctly?"
		 - "Is 'occurence' spelled correctly?"
		 - "Spell the word 'embarrass'."
		 - "Which is correct: 'seperate' or 'separate'?"
		 - "Is 'maintenance' spelled correctly?"
		 - "Is 'publically' spelled correctly?"
	5. **Agent Responses**: Limited to one word (token) to keep responses concise and focused.
	6. **Evaluation Data**: Ensured evaluation prompts were different from training prompts but still within the same domains to avoid overfitting. Examples:
	   - "Add 8 and seven."
	   - "What is 10 minus three?"
	   - "What is the past tense of eat?"
	   - "What is the plural of mouse?"
	   - "Is 'occurrence' spelled correctly?"
	   - "Is 'recieve' spelled correctly?"
	   - "Multiply 6 by two."
	   - "What is 180 divided by three?"
	   - "What is the superlative form of bad?"
	   - "Is 'privilege' spelled correctly?"
	   - "Is 1200 an even number?"
	   - "True or false: 5 is an odd number."
	   - "What is the past tense of 'see'?"
	   - "Is 'they' a pronoun?"
	   - "Spell the word 'accommodate'."
	7. **Semantic and Syntactic Variation**: Changed the phrasing and structure of prompts to prevent overfitting and ensure the model learns a wide range of expressions.
	8. **Token Limit**: Ensured the input prompt did not exceed 128 tokens.
	9. **Language Style**: All prompt-response pairs are in English.
	10. **Quantity**: Create 5 unique training data and evaluation messages with 1 user prompt and 1 agent response each; 10 total.
	11. **Uniqueness**: Ensure all messages are unique from any previously generated messages.
	12. **Character Restrictions**: Prompt and response pair content should not contain any special characters other than basic punctuation and quote marks, i.e., only characters found on a common English keyboard.
	13. **Final Step**: No explain. Only json.

Begin:
---
always generate unique messages.
make questions harder.
add prompt response pairs that include spelling questions like `A is the second letter in Cat.` or `How many times does the letter e appear in the phrase 'cats are awesome!'?
prompts generated no longer then 128 words.
response always one word.
focus on math with special symbols.
