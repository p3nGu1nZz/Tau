## Introduction

The Tau LLM Unity ML Agents project is an innovative initiative to create an intelligent chatbot using reinforcement learning and natural language processing techniques. By leveraging Unity's ML-Agents toolkit and Sentence Transformers, we aim to develop a robust and efficient language model.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Train agents using Unity ML-Agents.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilize Sentence Transformers for language understanding.
- **Customizable Environments**: Create and modify training environments in Unity.
- **Scalable Training**: Support for training on multiple environments and configurations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2021.3 or later
- Python 3.8 or later
- ML-Agents Toolkit
- Sentence Transformers

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tau-llm-unity-ml-agents.git
    cd Tau\MLAgentsProject
    ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
    ```bash
    .\Scripts\setup.bat
    ```

3. **Open the project in Unity**:
    - Launch Unity Hub.
    - Click on "Add" and select the project directory.

4. **Set up ML-Agents**:
    - Follow the [ML-Agents installation guide](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. **Configure the training environment**:
    - Modify the `config.yaml` file to set up your training parameters.

2. **Start training**:
    ```bash
    mlagents-learn config.yaml --run-id=<run-id>
    ```

3. **Monitor training**:
    - Use TensorBoard to visualize training metrics:
    ```bash
    tensorboard --logdir results
    ```

### Running Inference

1. **Load the trained model in Unity**:
    - Drag and drop the trained model file into the Unity project.

2. **Test the agent**:
    - Run the Unity scene to see the agent in action.
